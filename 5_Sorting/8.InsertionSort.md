# Insertion Sort

## Definition:

- Insertion sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position among the previously sorted elements.

## How it works (Concept):

    1. Start from the second element.
    2. Compare it with elements before it.
    3. Shift larger elements to the right.
    4. Insert the current element in its correct place.
    5. Repeat for all elements.

## Pseudocode:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    j = i
    while (j > 0) and A[j-1] > A[j]
        swap A[j] and A[j-1]
        j--;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: 

    - Best case: O(n)
    - Worst case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
    - Average: O(n<sup>2</sup>)

**Space Complexity**: 

    - O(1) because it only create 1 extra variable which is key, all the shifts happen inside original array
