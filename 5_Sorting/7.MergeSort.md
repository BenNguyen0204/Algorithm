# Merge Sort

## Definition:

- Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

## High level idea:

    [merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqmGXwpLqc)

    1. Divide the array into two halves
    2. Sort each half (recursively)
    3. Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted array

## Pseudocode

```cpp
mergeSort(A):
    if A has 1 element:
        return A

    split A into leftHalf and rightHalf

    leftSorted = mergeSort(leftHalf)
    rightSorted = mergeSort(rightHalf)

    return merge(leftSorted, rightSorted)

merge(L, R):
    array c // a dynamic array, or we can use a vector
    i = 0
    j = 0

    while (i < length(L) and j < length(R)):
        if L[i] <= R[j]:
            add L[i] to end of C // extend the length of c
            i = i + 1
        else:
            add R[j] to end of C
            j = j + 1
    // At this point either a or b is empty

    while (L has elements)
        add L[0] to the end of c // extend the length of c
        remove L[0 from a]

    while (R has elements)
        add R[0] to the end of c // extend the length of c
        remove b[0] from b

    return c;
```

**Time Complexity**

- Best O(n logn)
- Worst O(n logn)
- Average O(n logn)

**Space complexity**

- O(n) needs temporary array
