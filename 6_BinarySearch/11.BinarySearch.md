# Binary Search

## Definition:

- Binary Search finds a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly cutting the search range in half.

## How it works:

1. Look at the middle element.
2. If it equals the target → found.
3. If target is smaller, search the left half.
4. If target is bigger, search the right half.
5. Repeat until range is empty.
6. Each step cuts the search space by 50%.

## Requirements:

- Array must be **sorted**. If not then use linear search
- Allows O(log n) search time
- Cannot be used on unsorted data

## Pseudocode:

```cpp
binarySearch(A, target):
    left = 0
    right = n - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) / 2

        if A[mid] == target:
            return mid

        else if A[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1

        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1   // not found
```

**Time complexity**

- Best case: O(1) (found at middle)
- Worst case: O(log n)
- Average: O(log n)

**Space complexity**

- O(1) if iterative
- O(logn) (recursive due to call stack)
