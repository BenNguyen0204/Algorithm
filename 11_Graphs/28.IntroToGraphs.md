# Graph

## Definition:
- A graph is a data structure made of: vertices and edges
- Have 2 types:
    1. Undirected Graph
    2. Directed Graph
- Edge Weights:
    1. Unweighted
    2. Weighted
- Terminology:
    1. Degree (undirected): number of edges touching the node
    2. In-degree (directed): edges coming into the node
    3. Out-degree (directed): edges going out of the node
    4. Path: sequence of connected edges
    5. Cycle: path that starts and ends at same node
    6. Connected graph: every vertex reachable
    6. Component: a maximal subgraph that is connected

## Graph Representation

- Adjacency Matrix
    - V×V matrix A
    - A[i][j] = 1 if edge (i,j) ∈ E
    - Pros: check edge in O(1)
    - Cons: O(V²) space 

- Adjacency List
    - For each v: list neighbors
    - Pros: O(V + E) space
    - Cons: checking if edge exists = O(deg(v))
    - Total space = Σ(1 + deg(v)) = O(V + E)

## Graph Traversal

1. DFS
    - Type of edges: 
        1. tree edge (s -> next vertex)
        2. back edge (points to ancestor)
        3. forward edge (points to descendant)
        4. cross edge (between subtrees)
2. BFS

## Directed Cycles

- A directed graph has a directed cycle iff its DFS tree contains a back edge.

## DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

- A directed graph with no cycles (i.e., no back edges).

## Strongly Connected Components

- Two vertices u, v are strongly connected if:
    - u → v reachable
    - v → u reachable
