# Array in Memory: (Everything will be in c++)

## Definition:

- A data structure is a method of organizing data efficiently inside RAM.
- RAM stores everything as bits (0s and 1s), grouped into bytes (1 byte = 8 bits).
- An array stores elements in contiguous memory.
- Type:
    - char / bool - 1 byte
    - short - 2 bytes
    - int / float - 4 bytes
    - double - 8 byes
    - pointer - 8 bytes

# Static Array:

- Size cannot change after creation.
- Can cause wasted memory if overestimated.
- Cannot dynamically grow like vector.

## How to use:

- Declaration: int arr[5];
- Initialization:
    - int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    - int arr2[] = {10, 20, 30};   // compiler counts size = 3
- Accessing Elements: 
    - cout << arr[0];
    - arr[2] = 99;      // modify element at index 2
- Memory Layout:
    - Address of arr[i] = base_address + i * sizeof(type)
- Time:
    - Access / Update: O(1)
    - Traverse: O(n) (Mean visiting each element one by one):
    ```html
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i];
    }
    ```
    - Insert / Delete at middle: O(n) (shifting required)
    ```html
    int arr[6] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    // Insert X at index 2, have to shift element in index 4 to 5, 3 to 4, 2 to 3 
    ```

# Dynamic Array:

- A dynamic array is an array whose size is decided at runtime, not compile time.
- Modern c++ uses vector instead. No need for new and delete.
- How to use:   
    ``` html
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int* arr = new int[n];          // allocate
    arr[0] = 10;                    // use
    delete[] arr;                   // dellocate (must to do avoid memory leaks)
    ```
