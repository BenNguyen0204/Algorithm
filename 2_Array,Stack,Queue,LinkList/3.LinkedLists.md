# Singly Linked List

## Definition:
- A linear structure made of nodes.
- Each node stores:
    - a value
    - a pointer to the next node
    - And it only moves forward.
- Use it for
    - Fast insertion/removal at head
    - Good when the size changes often
    - No need for contiguous memory (unlike arrays)

## Basic node structure:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
```

## Operations:
    - insert at head — O(1)
    - insert at tail — O(n) unless you track a tail pointer
    - delete node — O(n) (need to find it)
    - search — O(n)
        - Because the first node must always be the head
    - access by index — O(n) (no random access)
    ```cpp
    Example:
    int get(Node* head, int index) {
        Node* curr = head;
        int i = 0;

        while (curr != nullptr && i < index) {
            curr = curr->next;   // move forward
            i++;
        }
        return curr->data;       // this is the index-th node
    }
    ```


# Doubly Linked List

## Definition:
- A linear structure made of nodes.
- Each node stores:
    - a value
    - pointer to next node
    - pointer to previous node
    - Can move forward and backward.
- Advantages:
    - Can traverse backwards
    - Deleting a node is easier (direct access to prev)
    - Better for operations in the middle
- Disadvantages:
    - Uses more memory (extra pointer)

## Basic node structure:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node* prev;
};
```

## Operations:
    - insert at head — O(1)
    - insert at tail — O(1) if you maintain a tail pointer
    - delete node when given pointer — O(1)
    - search — O(n)
