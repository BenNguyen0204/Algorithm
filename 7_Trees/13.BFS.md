# BFS (Breadth-First Search)

## Definition:

- BFS explores a graph level by level, starting from a source node.
- It uses a queue and processes nodes in FIFO order.

## How BFS Works

1. Start at the source node s
2. Mark s as visited
3. Put s into a queue
4. While queue is not empty:
    - pop the front node
    - Visit all unvisited neighbors of it
    - Mark visited and enqueue them

## Pseudocode

```cpp
bfs(G(V,E), s):
    create queue q
    mark s visited
    q.push(s)

    while q is not empty: // O(V)
        v = q.front(); q.pop() // O(1)
        for each neighbor u of v: // O(E)
            if u is unvisited:
                parent(u) = v and dist(u) = dist(v)+1
                mark u visited
                q.push(u)

// TIme complexity = O(V+E)
// Space complexity = O(V) for queue + visited array

```

## BFS in trees:

```cpp
queue.push(root)
while queue:
    node = queue.pop()
    process node
    if node.left: queue.push(node.left)
    if node.right: queue.push(node.right)
```
